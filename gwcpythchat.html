        <p>Our first Python Chatbot was held on October 21, 2021. We worked through "Get Started", "Part 1: Python Basics", and "Part 2: Variables" (specifically slides 3 and 4 of each). To save your progress make sure you have a Trinket account (set up it explained within the "Get Started" introduction).</p>
        <p>Our second python chatbot meeting was held on November 11, 2021. We worked through "Part 3: Loops" and "Part 4: Conditionals" (slides 3 and 4).</p>
        <p>Keep on updating your chatbot! Here's an example: <a href="Screen Shot 2021-11-17 at 11.48.31 AM.png">Python Chatbot</a>.</p>
